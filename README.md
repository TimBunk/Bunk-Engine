## Bunk-Engine
Bunk-Engine, is a multi purpose engine in progress. It can be used too make games and applications.
The main goal for me is to learn more about game-engines, graphics, neural networking and much more.
So far the engine will most likely only compile using visual studio 2019.
## Cloning
It is best to clone using git bash using this command:
```
  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TimBunk/Bunk-Engine
```
This will also clone all of the submodules that are being used.
## Notes
The engine can be used using visual studio 2019
